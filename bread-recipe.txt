Ingredients:
 - 500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 7g sachet fast-action yeast
 - 3 tbsp olive oil
 - 300ml water

Directions:

1. Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.
2. Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.
3. Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.
4. Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.
5. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.
6. Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.
7. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.
